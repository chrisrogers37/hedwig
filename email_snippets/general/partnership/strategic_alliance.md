Hi {{recipient_name}},

I've been following {{company_name}}'s impressive work in {{industry_or_domain}}, particularly your {{specific_achievement_or_initiative}}.

I believe there's a compelling opportunity for {{sender_company}} and {{company_name}} to collaborate on {{partnership_idea}}.

Here's why I think this could be mutually beneficial:

- {{benefit_1_for_their_company}}
- {{benefit_2_for_their_company}}
- {{benefit_3_for_their_company}}

We could start with {{initial_collaboration_idea}} and explore deeper partnership opportunities based on the results.

Would you be interested in a 30-minute call to discuss this potential collaboration? I'd love to learn more about {{company_name}}'s strategic priorities and see how we might align.

Best regards,
{{sender_name}}
{{sender_title}}
{{sender_company}}
