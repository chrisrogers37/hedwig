    Hi {{recipient_name}},

    I hope this note finds you well. I'm {{sender_name}}, a DJ that plays {{music_style}} based in {{location}}.

    I've been to {{venue_name}} several times over the last few years and I am a big fan. I love the crowd and the vibe of the venue. I have been DJing for {{experience_duration}} in {{location}} and have played at similar spots like {{similar_venues}}. I would love to discuss potentially playing at {{venue_name}}.

    If you're interested, I'm down to talk more at your earliest convenience. Please let me know if you'd like me to share links to sets or any other details.

    Looking forward to hearing from you!

    Best regards,
    {{sender_name}}
