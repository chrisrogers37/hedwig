    Hi {{recipient_name}},

    I'm {{sender_name}}, and I play with {{band_name}}, an {{genre}} band based in {{location}}.

    We've been following the shows at {{venue_name}} and love the energy your venue brings to the local music scene. Our recent gigs at {{other_venues}} have been a blast, and we've built a solid following in the area.

    We'd love to bring our live set to {{venue_name}} and help make your next gig night a success. We can provide all our own gear and promote the show to our fans.

    Would you be open to chatting about booking us for an upcoming date? I can send over our EPK and some live recordings if you're interested.

    Thanks for your time, and hope to hear from you soon!

    Best,
    {{sender_name}}
